# Chat-Project
### By ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Daniel-Vazana-blue)
A mini project I created during my 12th grade cyber class. 
The project is chat, encrypted by Caesar encryption (at that time I have not yet learned encryption) and is managed by Threads and Server.
The project is group chat and private chats.
